This example is addressed to show the convergence of the Stochastic LL filter to the exact Minimum Variance Filter in the case that the SDE has multimodal stationary distribution. 

In consequence, it also illustrates the convergence of the approximate innovation estimator with Stochastic LL filter to the exact innovation estimator. 

The example shows the high accuracy of the innovation estimates with the Stochastic LL filter in comparison with the Classical and Adaptive Deterministic filters.
